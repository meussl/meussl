If you choose to display the GeoTrust Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the applicable GeoTrust Seal License Agreement published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) GeoTrust discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the PKI.\r\n\r\n6.

Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) GeoTrust discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration.

Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust.

The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a SSL Certificate, which is used to support SSL/TLS sessions between a web browser and web server using encryption. Upon Symantec's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Symantec will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Symantec will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Symantec of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Symantec may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n3. Collateral Services.

If you are using the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Symantec expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. SYMANTEC CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.

You represent and warrant to Symantec and Relying Parties that (i) all information material to the issuance of a Certificate you provide to Symantec in your Certificate Application is accurate and complete; (ii) you will inform Symantec if the representations you made to Symantec in your Certificate Application changed or are no longer valid; (iii) the Certificate information you provided (including your e-mail address) does not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (iv) the Certificate information you provided (including your email address) has not been and will not be used for any unlawful purpose; (v) you, or someone explicitly authorized by you, have been (since the time of its creation) and will remain the only person(s) possessing your private key, or any challenge phrase, PIN, software, or hardware mechanism protecting the private key, and no unauthorized person has had or will have access to such materials or information; (vi) you will use your Certificate exclusively for authorized and lawful purposes consistent with this Agreement; (vii) you will use your Certificate as an end user and not as a Certification Authority to issue Certificates, certification revocation lists, or otherwise; (viii) each digital signature created using your private key is the Subscriber's digital signature, and the Certificate has been accepted and is operational (not expired or revoked) at the time the digital signature is created; (ix) you manifest assent to this Agreement as a condition of obtaining a Certificate; and (x) you will not monitor, interfere with, or reverse engineer (save to the extent that you cannot be prohibited from so doing under applicable law) the technical implementation of the STN, except with the prior written approval from Symantec, and shall not otherwise intentionally compromise the security of the STN. You further represent and warrant that you have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the extent to which you choose to rely on a digital certificate issued within the STN, that you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to rely on such information, and that you shall bear the legal consequences of your failure to perform any obligation you might have as a Relying Party under the applicable Relying Party Agreement.

This Section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy.

The terms of this Section 15 will survive any termination of this Agreement. As a Relying Party, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Symantec, its directors, shareholders, officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns from any and all third party claims, suits, proceedings, judgments, damages, and costs (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) arising from (i) your failure to perform the obligations of a Relying Party as set forth in the applicable Relying Party Agreement; (ii) your reliance on a Certificate that is not reasonable under the circumstances; or (iii) your failure to check the status of such Certificate to determine whether the certificate is expired or revoked.\r\n\r\n16.

The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a SSL Certificate, which is used to support SSL/TLS sessions between a web browser and web server using encryption. Upon Symantec's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Symantec will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Symantec will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Symantec of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Symantec may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n3. Collateral Services.

If you are using the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Symantec expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. SYMANTEC CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.

This Agreement shall remain in effect until your Certificate has expired or is earlier revoked.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 Symantec Representations and Warranties. Symantec represents and warrants that (i) there are no errors introduced by Symantec in the Certificate information as a result of Symantec's failure to use reasonable care in creating the Certificate; (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material respects with its CPS; and (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to its CPS in all material aspects.\r\n\r\n8.2 Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant to Symantec and Relying Parties that (i) all information material to the issuance of a Certificate you provide to Symantec in your Certificate Application is accurate and complete; (ii) you will inform Symantec if the representations you made to Symantec in your Certificate Application changed or are no longer valid; (iii) the Certificate information you provided (including your e-mail address) does not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (iv) the Certificate information you provided (including your email address) has not been and will not be used for any unlawful purpose; (v) you, or someone explicitly authorized by you, have been (since the time of its creation) and will remain the only person(s) possessing your private key, or any challenge phrase, PIN, software, or hardware mechanism protecting the private key, and no unauthorized person has had or will have access to such materials or information; (vi) you will use your Certificate exclusively for authorized and lawful purposes consistent with this Agreement; (vii) you will use your Certificate as an end user and not as a Certification Authority to issue Certificates, certification revocation lists, or otherwise; (viii) each digital signature created using your private key is the Subscriber's digital signature, and the Certificate has been accepted and is operational (not expired or revoked) at the time the digital signature is created; (ix) you manifest assent to this Agreement as a condition of obtaining a Certificate; and (x) you will not monitor, interfere with, or reverse engineer (save to the extent that you cannot be prohibited from so doing under applicable law) the technical implementation of the STN, except with the prior written approval from Symantec, and shall not otherwise intentionally compromise the security of the STN.

This Section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy.

The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a SSL Certificate, which is used to support SSL/TLS sessions between a web browser and web server using encryption. Upon Symantec's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Symantec will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Symantec will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Symantec of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Symantec may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n3. Collateral Services.

If you are using the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Symantec expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. SYMANTEC CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.

This Agreement shall remain in effect until your Certificate has expired or is earlier revoked.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 Symantec Representations and Warranties. Symantec represents and warrants that (i) there are no errors introduced by Symantec in the Certificate information as a result of Symantec's failure to use reasonable care in creating the Certificate; (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material respects with its CPS; and (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to its CPS in all material aspects.\r\n\r\n8.2 Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant to Symantec and Relying Parties that (i) all information material to the issuance of a Certificate you provide to Symantec in your Certificate Application is accurate and complete; (ii) you will inform Symantec if the representations you made to Symantec in your Certificate Application changed or are no longer valid; (iii) the Certificate information you provided (including your e-mail address) does not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (iv) the Certificate information you provided (including your email address) has not been and will not be used for any unlawful purpose; (v) you, or someone explicitly authorized by you, have been (since the time of its creation) and will remain the only person(s) possessing your private key, or any challenge phrase, PIN, software, or hardware mechanism protecting the private key, and no unauthorized person has had or will have access to such materials or information; (vi) you will use your Certificate exclusively for authorized and lawful purposes consistent with this Agreement; (vii) you will use your Certificate as an end user and not as a Certification Authority to issue Certificates, certification revocation lists, or otherwise; (viii) each digital signature created using your private key is the Subscriber's digital signature, and the Certificate has been accepted and is operational (not expired or revoked) at the time the digital signature is created; (ix) you manifest assent to this Agreement as a condition of obtaining a Certificate; and (x) you will not monitor, interfere with, or reverse engineer (save to the extent that you cannot be prohibited from so doing under applicable law) the technical implementation of the STN, except with the prior written approval from Symantec, and shall not otherwise intentionally compromise the security of the STN. You further represent and warrant that you have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the extent to which you choose to rely on a digital certificate issued within the STN, that you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to rely on such information, and that you shall bear the legal consequences of your failure to perform any obligation you might have as a Relying Party under the applicable Relying Party Agreement.

All payments due to Symantec shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, Symantec receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This Section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy.

Processing the Certificate Application. The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a SSL Certificate, which is used to support SSL/TLS sessions between a web browser and web server using encryption. Upon Symantec's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Symantec will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Symantec will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Symantec of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Symantec may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n3. Collateral Services. Symantec may make available to you additional Services such as, but not limited to: (i) daily scanning of your website for malicious code; (ii) vulnerability assessment of your network environment; (iii) Seal services; and/or (iv) access to the account management features and functionality through a web-based console. Provision of such Services may be subject to prerequisites imposed at Symantec's sole discretion.\r\n\r\n4. Use and Restrictions. You may install the Certificate only on servers that are accessible at the subjectAltName(s) listed in the Certificate. You are prohibited from using your Certificate (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; (iii) on more than one physical server or device at a time, unless you have purchased the Licensed Certificate Option; (iv) if a WLAN Server Certificate, on any device other than a RADIUS server; and (v) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you are using the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Symantec expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. SYMANTEC CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. Certificates purchased under the Licensed Certificate Option limit the amount of recovery under the NetSure Protection Plan to ten thousand US dollars (US $10,000) or the local currency equivalent thereof. If you choose to display the Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the Seal License Agreement published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Reporting and Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is, or has become, incorrect or inaccurate, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately cease using the Certificate and its associated private key, and you must notify Symantec. If Symantec discovers or has reason to believe that there has been a compromise of your private key or misuse of your Certificate, you must respond to Symantec's instructions within the time specified by Symantec. Symantec retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) Symantec discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you violate or fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) Symantec determines in its sole discretion that the continued use of your Certificate may compromise the security or integrity of the STN. Symantec may also revoke your Certificate for non-payment.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall promptly remove your Certificate from all devices on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter. If you have installed a Seal in conjunction with the revoked Certificate, then you shall remove such seal from your website.\r\n\r\n7. Term of Service. This Agreement shall remain in effect until your Certificate has expired or is earlier revoked.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 Symantec Representations and Warranties. Symantec represents and warrants that (i) there are no errors introduced by Symantec in the Certificate information as a result of Symantec's failure to use reasonable care in creating the Certificate; (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material respects with its CPS; and (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to its CPS in all material aspects.\r\n\r\n8.2 Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant to Symantec and Relying Parties that (i) all information material to the issuance of a Certificate you provide to Symantec in your Certificate Application is accurate and complete; (ii) you will inform Symantec if the representations you made to Symantec in your Certificate Application changed or are no longer valid; (iii) the Certificate information you provided (including your e-mail address) does not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (iv) the Certificate information you provided (including your email address) has not been and will not be used for any unlawful purpose; (v) you, or someone explicitly authorized by you, have been (since the time of its creation) and will remain the only person(s) possessing your private key, or any challenge phrase, PIN, software, or hardware mechanism protecting the private key, and no unauthorized person has had or will have access to such materials or information; (vi) you will use your Certificate exclusively for authorized and lawful purposes consistent with this Agreement; (vii) you will use your Certificate as an end user and not as a Certification Authority to issue Certificates, certification revocation lists, or otherwise; (viii) each digital signature created using your private key is the Subscriber's digital signature, and the Certificate has been accepted and is operational (not expired or revoked) at the time the digital signature is created; (ix) you manifest assent to this Agreement as a condition of obtaining a Certificate; and (x) you will not monitor, interfere with, or reverse engineer (save to the extent that you cannot be prohibited from so doing under applicable law) the technical implementation of the STN, except with the prior written approval from Symantec, and shall not otherwise intentionally compromise the security of the STN. You further represent and warrant that you have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the extent to which you choose to rely on a digital certificate issued within the STN, that you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to rely on such information, and that you shall bear the legal consequences of your failure to perform any obligation you might have as a Relying Party under the applicable Relying Party Agreement. If your Services include malware and/or vulnerability assessment, you further represent and warrant to Symantec that (xi) you have the corporate power and authority to give Symantec consent to proceed with the assessment; if your website is managed and/or hosted by a third-party service provider, you warrant that you have obtained the consent and authorization from the service provider necessary for Symantec to perform the assessment.\r\n\r\n8.3 Reseller Representations and Warranties.

All payments due to Symantec shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, Symantec receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This Section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. If you are not completely satisfied with the Certificate issued to you for any reason, you must request, within thirty (30) days of Certificate issuance, that Symantec revoke the Certificate and provide you with a refund.

If your Certificate Application is approved, Symantec will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Symantec of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Symantec may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n3. Collateral Services. Symantec may make available to you additional Services such as, but not limited to: (i) daily scanning of your website for malicious code; (ii) vulnerability assessment of your network environment; (iii) Seal services; and/or (iv) access to the account management features and functionality through a web-based console. Provision of such Services may be subject to prerequisites imposed at Symantec's sole discretion.\r\n\r\n4. Use and Restrictions.

You are prohibited from using your Certificate (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; (iii) on more than one physical server or device at a time, unless you have purchased the Licensed Certificate Option; (iv) if a WLAN Server Certificate, on any device other than a RADIUS server; and (v) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you are using the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Symantec expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. SYMANTEC CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. Certificates purchased under the Licensed Certificate Option limit the amount of recovery under the NetSure Protection Plan to ten thousand US dollars (US $10,000) or the local currency equivalent thereof. If you choose to display the Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the Seal License Agreement published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Reporting and Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is, or has become, incorrect or inaccurate, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately cease using the Certificate and its associated private key, and you must notify Symantec. If Symantec discovers or has reason to believe that there has been a compromise of your private key or misuse of your Certificate, you must respond to Symantec's instructions within the time specified by Symantec. Symantec retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) Symantec discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you violate or fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) Symantec determines in its sole discretion that the continued use of your Certificate may compromise the security or integrity of the STN. Symantec may also revoke your Certificate for non-payment.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall promptly remove your Certificate from all devices on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter. If you have installed a Seal in conjunction with the revoked Certificate, then you shall remove such seal from your website.\r\n\r\n7. Term of Service.

Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust.

Description of the Certificate. The following applies to GeoTrust True BusinessID,\r\nTrue BusinessID Wildcard, Enterprise SSL, Enterprise SSL Premium, and Enterprise\r\nSSL Wildcard Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a fully-authenticated certificate within the GeoTrust PKI. These Certificates are issued to devices to provide authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. Fully-authenticated Certificates provide assurances of the identity of the Subscriber based on a confirmation that the Subscriber organization does in fact exist. The Certificate also provides assurances that the Subscriber is entitled to use the domain name listed in the Certificate Application, if a domain name is listed in such Certificate Application.\r\n\r\nThe following applies to GeoTrust QuickSSL, QuickSSL Premium, Power Server ID, and\r\nPower Server ID Wildcard Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is not a fully-authenticated Certificate within the GeoTrust PKI. These Certificates are issued to devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. These Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\nIf you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then GeoTrust will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines.\r\n\r\n3.

If your Certificate Application is approved, GeoTrust will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement.

Upon receipt of such notice, GeoTrust may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; and (iii) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage.  If you choose to display the GeoTrust Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the applicable GeoTrust Seal License Agreement published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) GeoTrust discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration.

All taxes, duties, fees and other governmental charges of any kind (including sales, services, use, and value-added taxes, but excluding taxes based on the net income of GeoTrust) which are imposed by or under the authority of any government on the service fees charged herein shall be borne by you and shall not be considered a part of, a deduction from or an offset against such service fees. All payments due to GeoTrust shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, GeoTrust receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. GeoTrust shall provide refunds pursuant to its Refund Policy published on its web site.\r\n\r\n11. Proprietary Rights.

No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\nIf you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then GeoTrust will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines.\r\n\r\n3.

You are prohibited from using your Certificate (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; and (iii) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage.  If you choose to display the GeoTrust Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the applicable GeoTrust Seal License Agreement published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) GeoTrust discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration.

All payments due to GeoTrust shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, GeoTrust receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. GeoTrust shall provide refunds pursuant to its Refund Policy published on its web site.\r\n\r\n11. Proprietary Rights.

Description of the Certificate. The following applies to GeoTrust True BusinessID,\r\nTrue BusinessID Wildcard, Enterprise SSL, Enterprise SSL Premium, and Enterprise\r\nSSL Wildcard Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a fully-authenticated certificate within the GeoTrust PKI. These Certificates are issued to devices to provide authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. Fully-authenticated Certificates provide assurances of the identity of the Subscriber based on a confirmation that the Subscriber organization does in fact exist. The Certificate also provides assurances that the Subscriber is entitled to use the domain name listed in the Certificate Application, if a domain name is listed in such Certificate Application.\r\n\r\nThe following applies to GeoTrust QuickSSL, QuickSSL Premium, Power Server ID, and\r\nPower Server ID Wildcard Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is not a fully-authenticated Certificate within the GeoTrust PKI. These Certificates are issued to devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. These Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\nIf you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then GeoTrust will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines.\r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application. Upon GeoTrust's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, GeoTrust will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, GeoTrust will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify GeoTrust of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, GeoTrust may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; and (iii) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage.  If you choose to display the GeoTrust Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the applicable GeoTrust Seal License Agreement published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) GeoTrust discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from all devices on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter. If you have installed a GeoTrust Seal in conjunction with the revoked Certification, then you shall remove such seal from your website.\r\n\r\n7. Term of Service. This Agreement shall remain in effect until your Certificate has expired or is earlier revoked.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 GeoTrust Representations and Warranties. GeoTrust represents and warrants that (i) there are no errors introduced by GeoTrust in the Certificate information as a result of GeoTrust's failure to use reasonable care in creating the Certificate; (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material respects with its CPS; and (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to its CPS in all material aspects.\r\n\r\n8.2 Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant to GeoTrust and Relying Parties that (i) all information material to the issuance of a Certificate you provide to GeoTrust in your Certificate Application is accurate; (ii) you will inform GeoTrust if the representations you made to GeoTrust in your Certificate Application changed or are no longer valid; (iii) the Certificate information you provided (including your e-mail address) does not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (iv) the Certificate information you provided (including your email address) has not been and will not be used for any unlawful purpose; (v) you have been (since the time of its creation) and will remain the only person possessing your private key, or any challenge phrase, PIN, software, or hardware mechanism protecting the private key, and no unauthorized person has had or will have access to such materials or information; (vi) you will use your Certificate exclusively for authorized and legal purposes consistent with this Agreement; (vii) you will use your Certificate as an end user and not as a\r\nCertification Authority to issue Certificates, certification revocation lists, or otherwise; (viii) each digital signature created using your private key is the Subscriber’s digital signature, and the Certificate has been accepted and is operational (not expired or revoked) at the time the digital signature is created; (ix) you manifest assent to this Agreement as a condition of obtaining a Certificate; and (x) you will not monitor, interfere with, or reverse engineer (save to the extent that you can not be prohibited from so doing under applicable law) the technical implementation of the PKI, except with the prior written approval from GeoTrust, and shall not otherwise intentionally compromise the security of the PKI. You further represent and warrant that you have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the extent to which you choose to rely on a digital certificate issued within the PKI, that you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to rely on such information, and that you shall bear the legal consequences of your failure to perform any obligation you might have as a Relying Party under the applicable Relying Party Agreement.\r\n\r\n8.3 Reseller Representations and Warranties.

All payments due to GeoTrust shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, GeoTrust receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. GeoTrust shall provide refunds pursuant to its Refund Policy published on its web site.\r\n\r\n11. Proprietary Rights.

Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) GeoTrust discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the PKI.\r\n\r\n6.

These Certificates are issued to devices to provide authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. Fully-authenticated Certificates provide assurances of the identity of the Subscriber based on a confirmation that the Subscriber organization does in fact exist.

No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\nIf you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then GeoTrust will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines.\r\n\r\n3.

You are prohibited from using your Certificate (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; and (iii) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage.  If you choose to display the GeoTrust Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the applicable GeoTrust Seal License Agreement published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) GeoTrust discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration.

All payments due to GeoTrust shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, GeoTrust receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. GeoTrust shall provide refunds pursuant to its Refund Policy published on its web site.\r\n\r\n11. Proprietary Rights.

You are prohibited from using your Certificate (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; and (iii) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage.  If you choose to display the GeoTrust Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the applicable GeoTrust Seal License Agreement published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if (i) GeoTrust discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration.

All taxes, duties, fees and other governmental charges of any kind (including sales, services, use, and value-added taxes, but excluding taxes based on the net income of GeoTrust) which are imposed by or under the authority of any government on the service fees charged herein shall be borne by you and shall not be considered a part of, a deduction from or an offset against such service fees. All payments due to GeoTrust shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, GeoTrust receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. GeoTrust shall provide refunds pursuant to its Refund Policy published on its web site.\r\n\r\n11. Proprietary Rights.

Additional Liability.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Intellectual Property Rights. \r\n\r\n4.1. Sectigo IP Rights.

Indemnification.\r\n\r\n5.1. Indemnification.  Subscriber shall indemnify Sectigo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Remedy.\r\n\r\n8.1. Injunctive Relief.  Subscriber acknowledges that its breach of this agreement will result in irreparable harm to Sectigo that cannot adequately be redressed by compensatory damages.

Subscriber acknowledges that risks remain that are beyond Sectigo's reasonable control and waives all liability of Sectigo for these risks.   \r\n\t(ii) Subscriber consents to 1) Sectigo disclosing Subscriber's information publicly by embedding the information in issued Certificates and 2) Sectigo disclosing and transferring Subscriber's information to third parties located outside of the European Union as necessary to validate and issue Certificates. \r\n\t(iii) Subscriber may opt-out of having information used for purposes not directly related to the Services by emailing a clear notice to optout@Sectigo.com.

Sectigo may amend this agreement, the CPS, the Relying Party Agreement, the Relying Party Warranty, its website, and any documents listed in its Repository at any time by posting either the amendment or the amended document in the Repository.  Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.  A party's failure to enforce a provision of this agreement will not waive the party's right to enforce the same provision later or right to enforce any other provision of this agreement.  To be effective, all waivers must be both in writing and signed by the party benefiting form the waived provision.  \r\n11.6. Assignment.  Subscriber may not assign any of its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of Sectigo.  Any transfer without consent is void.

Severability. Any provision determined invalid or unenforceable by rule of law will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make the provision valid and enforceable.

However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability.

Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.

Additional Liability.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.

Intellectual Property Rights. \r\n\r\n4.1. Sectigo IP Rights.

Indemnification.\r\n\r\n5.1. Indemnification.  Subscriber shall indemnify Sectigo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Remedy.\r\n\r\n8.1. Injunctive Relief.

Subscriber acknowledges that risks remain that are beyond Sectigo's reasonable control and waives all liability of Sectigo for these risks.   \r\n\t(ii) Subscriber consents to 1) Sectigo disclosing Subscriber's information publicly by embedding the information in issued Certificates and 2) Sectigo disclosing and transferring Subscriber's information to third parties located outside of the European Union as necessary to validate and issue Certificates. \r\n\t(iii) Subscriber may opt-out of having information used for purposes not directly related to the Services by emailing a clear notice to optout@Sectigo.com.

Sectigo may amend this agreement, the CPS, the Relying Party Agreement, the Relying Party Warranty, its website, and any documents listed in its Repository at any time by posting either the amendment or the amended document in the Repository.  Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.  A party's failure to enforce a provision of this agreement will not waive the party's right to enforce the same provision later or right to enforce any other provision of this agreement.  To be effective, all waivers must be both in writing and signed by the party benefiting form the waived provision.  \r\n11.6. Assignment.  Subscriber may not assign any of its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of Sectigo.  Any transfer without consent is void.

Severability. Any provision determined invalid or unenforceable by rule of law will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make the provision valid and enforceable.

This Section sets forth the terms and conditions regarding your application for a Certificate and, if GeoTrust and/or the RA accepts your Certificate Application, the terms and conditions regarding your use of the Certificate to be issued by GeoTrust to you as the \"Subscriber\" of that Certificate. A \"Certificate\" is a digitally signed message that contains an organization's public key and associates it with information Authenticated by GeoTrust or a GeoTrust-authorized entity. Certificates provided under this Subscriber Agreement are issued within the GeoTrust PKI.  The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is not a fully-authenticated Certificate within the GeoTrust PKI. These Certificates are issued to Devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. These Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain. \r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application & Re-Issues. Upon GeoTrust's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of Authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have purchased, GeoTrust will process your Certificate Application, and GeoTrust will notify you whether your Certificate Application is approved or rejected. If your Certificate Application is approved, GeoTrust will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Subscriber Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it before using it and promptly notify GeoTrust of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, GeoTrust may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate: (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any Domain and/or organization name other than the one(s) submitted by you on your Certificate Application; and (iii) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you choose to display the Seal, you must install and display such Seal only in accordance with the GeoTrust Seal License Agreement and any other terms and conditions as may be posted on the GeoTrust Web site.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a Compromise of your private key or the activation data protecting such private key, or the information within the Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organizational name and/or Domain registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust and request revocation of the Certificate and you must notify any person that may reasonably be expected by you to rely on or to provide services in support of the Certificate or a digital signature verifiable with reference to the Certificate. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate if, within forty-five (45) days of receiving an invoice from GeoTrust, you do not pay the invoice. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if: (i) GeoTrust\r\ndiscovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Subscriber Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the GeoTrust PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from the Device on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter and, if you have installed a Seal and have not purchased other GeoTrust services that would permit you to post the Seal, you shall remove such Seal from your Web site.\r\n\r\n7. Third-Party Service Providers. If you are purchasing a service from GeoTrust that includes one or more services provided by a third party, GeoTrust may disclose your Certificate Application and enrollment information to these third party service providers and they may contact you directly regarding their services.

Unless otherwise stated herein, any terms and conditions for these products shall be provided to you directly by the third party service provider. GeoTrust disclaims any and all warranties, refuses any\r\nand all liability, and shall not provide partial refunds for any service provided by a third party.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 GeoTrust Representations and Warranties.

This Section sets forth the terms and conditions regarding your application for a Certificate and, if GeoTrust and/or the RA accepts your Certificate Application, the terms and conditions regarding your use of the Certificate to be issued by GeoTrust to you as the \"Subscriber\" of that Certificate. A \"Certificate\" is a digitally signed message that contains an organization's public key and associates it with information Authenticated by GeoTrust or a GeoTrust-authorized entity. Certificates provided under this Subscriber Agreement are issued within the GeoTrust PKI.  The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is not a fully-authenticated Certificate within the GeoTrust PKI. These Certificates are issued to Devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. These Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain. \r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application & Re-Issues. Upon GeoTrust's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of Authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have purchased, GeoTrust will process your Certificate Application, and GeoTrust will notify you whether your Certificate Application is approved or rejected. If your Certificate Application is approved, GeoTrust will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Subscriber Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it before using it and promptly notify GeoTrust of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, GeoTrust may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate: (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any Domain and/or organization name other than the one(s) submitted by you on your Certificate Application; and (iii) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you choose to display the Seal, you must install and display such Seal only in accordance with the GeoTrust Seal License Agreement and any other terms and conditions as may be posted on the GeoTrust Web site.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a Compromise of your private key or the activation data protecting such private key, or the information within the Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organizational name and/or Domain registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust and request revocation of the Certificate and you must notify any person that may reasonably be expected by you to rely on or to provide services in support of the Certificate or a digital signature verifiable with reference to the Certificate. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate if, within forty-five (45) days of receiving an invoice from GeoTrust, you do not pay the invoice. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if: (i) GeoTrust\r\ndiscovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Subscriber Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the GeoTrust PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from the Device on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter and, if you have installed a Seal and have not purchased other GeoTrust services that would permit you to post the Seal, you shall remove such Seal from your Web site.\r\n\r\n7. Third-Party Service Providers. If you are purchasing a service from GeoTrust that includes one or more services provided by a third party, GeoTrust may disclose your Certificate Application and enrollment information to these third party service providers and they may contact you directly regarding their services. You hereby agree to GeoTrust's disclosure of your Certificate Application and enrollment information to these third party service providers and agree that they may contact you directly regarding their services.

Unless otherwise stated herein, any terms and conditions for these products shall be provided to you directly by the third party service provider. GeoTrust disclaims any and all warranties, refuses any\r\nand all liability, and shall not provide partial refunds for any service provided by a third party.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 GeoTrust Representations and Warranties.

This Section sets forth the terms and conditions regarding your application for a Certificate and, if GeoTrust and/or the RA accepts your Certificate Application, the terms and conditions regarding your use of the Certificate to be issued by GeoTrust to you as the \"Subscriber\" of that Certificate. A \"Certificate\" is a digitally signed message that contains an organization's public key and associates it with information Authenticated by GeoTrust or a GeoTrust-authorized entity. Certificates provided under this Subscriber Agreement are issued within the GeoTrust PKI.  The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is not a fully-authenticated Certificate within the GeoTrust PKI. These Certificates are issued to Devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. These Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an Intranet Server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain. \r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application & Re-Issues. Upon GeoTrust's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of Authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have purchased, GeoTrust will process your Certificate Application, and GeoTrust will notify you whether your Certificate Application is approved or rejected. If your Certificate Application is approved, GeoTrust will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Subscriber Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it before using it and promptly notify GeoTrust of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, GeoTrust may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate: (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any Domain and/or organization name other than the one(s) submitted by you on your Certificate Application; and (iii) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you choose to display the Seal, you must install and display such Seal only in accordance with the GeoTrust Seal License Agreement and any other terms and conditions as may be posted on the GeoTrust Web site.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a Compromise of your private key or the activation data protecting such private key, or the information within the Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organizational name and/or Domain registration has changed, you must immediately notify GeoTrust and request revocation of the Certificate and you must notify any person that may reasonably be expected by you to rely on or to provide services in support of the Certificate or a digital signature verifiable with reference to the Certificate. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate if, within forty-five (45) days of receiving an invoice from GeoTrust, you do not pay the invoice. GeoTrust retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if: (i) GeoTrust\r\ndiscovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Subscriber Agreement; or (iii) in GeoTrust's sole discretion, you have engaged in activities which GeoTrust determines are harmful to the GeoTrust PKI.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from the Device on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter and, if you have installed a Seal and have not purchased other GeoTrust services that would permit you to post the Seal, you shall remove such Seal from your Web site.\r\n\r\n7. Third-Party Service Providers. If you are purchasing a service from GeoTrust that includes one or more services provided by a third party, GeoTrust may disclose your Certificate Application and enrollment information to these third party service providers and they may contact you directly regarding their services. You hereby agree to GeoTrust's disclosure of your Certificate Application and enrollment information to these third party service providers and agree that they may contact you directly regarding their services.

Unless otherwise stated herein, any terms and conditions for these products shall be provided to you directly by the third party service provider. GeoTrust disclaims any and all warranties, refuses any\r\nand all liability, and shall not provide partial refunds for any service provided by a third party.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 GeoTrust Representations and Warranties.

Intellectual Property Rights. \r\n\r\n4.1. Sectigo IP Rights. Sectigo retains, and Subscriber shall not obtain or claim, all title, interest, and ownership rights in:\r\n\t(i) the Services, including issued Certificates,\r\n \t(ii) all copies or derivative works of the Services, regardless of who produced, requested, or suggested the copy or derivative work, \r\n\t(iii) all documentation and materials provided by Sectigo, and\r\n\t(iv) all of Sectigo's copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights and other proprietary rights. \r\n4.2.

Indemnification.\r\n\r\n5.1. Indemnification.  Subscriber shall indemnify Sectigo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3. Events Upon Termination.  After termination, Sectigo may revoke any other Certificate's issued to Subscriber without further notice.  Subscriber shall pay any amounts still owed for the Certificates.  Sectigo is not obligated to refund any payment made by Subscriber upon termination of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n7.1. Relying Party Warranties.  Subscriber acknowledges that the Relying Party Warranty is only for the benefit of Relying Parties.  Subscriber does not have rights under the warranty, including any right to enforce the terms of the warranty or make a claim under the warranty. \r\n7.2. Exclusion of Warranties.   THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\".   Sectigo EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED AND EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN THE SERVICES.

Remedy.\r\n\r\n8.1. Injunctive Relief.  Subscriber acknowledges that its breach of this agreement will result in irreparable harm to Sectigo that cannot adequately be redressed by compensatory damages.

The Receiving Party shall take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure and shall ensure that any person receiving Confidential Information complies with the restrictions in this section.

The restrictions contained in this section apply for the duration of the agreement plus five years after its termination.\r\n\r\n10. Privacy. \r\n\r\n\t(i) Sectigo shall follow the privacy policy posted on its website when receiving and using information from the Subscriber.  Sectigo may amend the privacy policy at any time by posting the amended privacy policy on its website.  Subject to Section 10(ii), Sectigo shall use reasonable efforts in protecting Subscriber's information.  Subscriber acknowledges that risks remain that are beyond Sectigo's reasonable control and waives all liability of Sectigo for these risks.   \r\n\t(ii) Subscriber consents to 1) Sectigo disclosing Subscriber's information publicly by embedding the information in issued Certificates and 2) Sectigo disclosing and transferring Subscriber's information to third parties located outside of the European Union as necessary to validate and issue Certificates. \r\n\t(iii) Subscriber may opt-out of having information used for purposes not directly related to the Services by emailing a clear notice to optout@Sectigo.com.  By clicking \"I AGREE\", Subscriber affirmatively consents to receiving Sectigo's and its affiliates marketing material.\r\n\r\n11. Miscellaneous. \r\n\r\n11.1. Force Majeure and Internet Frailties.  Other than for payment obligations by Subscriber, neither party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform an obligation to the extent that the delay or failure is caused by an occurrence beyond the party's reasonable control. Each party acknowledges that the operation of the Internet is beyond the other party's reasonable control, and neither party will be liable for a delay or failure caused by an interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, Internet slow-downs or failures, or other such transmission failure.  \r\n11.2. Notices.  You shall send all notices to Sectigo by first class mail in English writing, with return receipt requested, to Sectigo CA Limited, 26 Office Village, 3rd Floor, Exchange Quay, Trafford Road, Salford, Manchester M5 3EQ, United Kingdom.

This agreement and all documents referred to herein constitutes the entire agreement between the parties, superseding all other agreements that may exist with respect to the subject matter.  Section headings are for reference and convenience only and are not part of the interpretation of this agreement.   \r\n11.4. Amendments.  Sectigo may amend this agreement, the CPS, the Relying Party Agreement, the Relying Party Warranty, its website, and any documents listed in its Repository at any time by posting either the amendment or the amended document in the Repository.  Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.  A party's failure to enforce a provision of this agreement will not waive the party's right to enforce the same provision later or right to enforce any other provision of this agreement.  To be effective, all waivers must be both in writing and signed by the party benefiting form the waived provision.  \r\n11.6. Assignment.  Subscriber may not assign any of its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of Sectigo.  Any transfer without consent is void.

All proceedings or legal action arising from this agreement must be commenced in the courts of England and Wales.  Both parties agree to the exclusive venue and jurisdiction of these courts.\r\n11.8. Severability. Any provision determined invalid or unenforceable by rule of law will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make the provision valid and enforceable.  If reformation is not possible, the provision is deemed omitted and the balance of the agreement remains valid and enforceable.\r\n11.9. Survival.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability.

Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.

Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.

Subscriber shall indemnify Comodo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Comodo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Comodo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Comodo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Comodo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Comodo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Comodo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Comodo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Comodo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Intellectual Property Rights. \r\n\r\n4.1. Sectigo IP Rights. Sectigo retains, and Subscriber shall not obtain or claim, all title, interest, and ownership rights in:\r\n\t(i) the Services, including issued Certificates,\r\n \t(ii) all copies or derivative works of the Services, regardless of who produced, requested, or suggested the copy or derivative work, \r\n\t(iii) all documentation and materials provided by Sectigo, and\r\n\t(iv) all of Sectigo's copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights and other proprietary rights. \r\n4.2.

Indemnification.\r\n\r\n5.1. Indemnification.  Subscriber shall indemnify Sectigo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Remedy.\r\n\r\n8.1. Injunctive Relief.  Subscriber acknowledges that its breach of this agreement will result in irreparable harm to Sectigo that cannot adequately be redressed by compensatory damages.

Subscriber acknowledges that risks remain that are beyond Sectigo's reasonable control and waives all liability of Sectigo for these risks.   \r\n\t(ii) Subscriber consents to 1) Sectigo disclosing Subscriber's information publicly by embedding the information in issued Certificates and 2) Sectigo disclosing and transferring Subscriber's information to third parties located outside of the European Union as necessary to validate and issue Certificates. \r\n\t(iii) Subscriber may opt-out of having information used for purposes not directly related to the Services by emailing a clear notice to optout@Sectigo.com.

Sectigo may amend this agreement, the CPS, the Relying Party Agreement, the Relying Party Warranty, its website, and any documents listed in its Repository at any time by posting either the amendment or the amended document in the Repository.  Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.  A party's failure to enforce a provision of this agreement will not waive the party's right to enforce the same provision later or right to enforce any other provision of this agreement.  To be effective, all waivers must be both in writing and signed by the party benefiting form the waived provision.  \r\n11.6. Assignment.  Subscriber may not assign any of its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of Sectigo.  Any transfer without consent is void.

Additional Liability.

Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.

Indemnification.\r\n\r\n5.1. Indemnification.  Subscriber shall indemnify Sectigo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.

To be effective, all waivers must be both in writing and signed by the party benefiting form the waived provision.  \r\n11.6. Assignment.

Indemnification.\r\n\r\n5.1. Indemnification.  Subscriber shall indemnify Sectigo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.

Indemnification.\r\n\r\n5.1. Indemnification.  Subscriber shall indemnify Sectigo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Remedy.\r\n\r\n8.1. Injunctive Relief.  Subscriber acknowledges that its breach of this agreement will result in irreparable harm to Sectigo that cannot adequately be redressed by compensatory damages.

Subscriber acknowledges that risks remain that are beyond Sectigo's reasonable control and waives all liability of Sectigo for these risks.   \r\n\t(ii) Subscriber consents to 1) Sectigo disclosing Subscriber's information publicly by embedding the information in issued Certificates and 2) Sectigo disclosing and transferring Subscriber's information to third parties located outside of the European Union as necessary to validate and issue Certificates. \r\n\t(iii) Subscriber may opt-out of having information used for purposes not directly related to the Services by emailing a clear notice to optout@Sectigo.com.

Sectigo may amend this agreement, the CPS, the Relying Party Agreement, the Relying Party Warranty, its website, and any documents listed in its Repository at any time by posting either the amendment or the amended document in the Repository.  Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.

However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.

Subscriber shall indemnify Sectigo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.

However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability.

Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.

Remedy.\r\n\r\n8.1. Injunctive Relief.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.

Indemnification Procedure.  Sectigo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Sectigo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Sectigo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Sectigo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Sectigo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Sectigo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Sectigo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Sectigo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3.

Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.

Additional Liability.

Description of the Certificate. The following applies to the Thawte SSL Web Server, SSL Web Server With Extended Validation, SSL Web Server Wildcard and SGC SuperCert Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a High Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. High Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. High Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the identity of the Subscriber based on a confirmation that the Subscriber organization does in fact exist, that the organization has authorized the Certificate Application, and that the person submitting the Certificate Application on behalf of the Subscriber was authorized to do so. The Certificate also provides assurances that the Subscriber is entitled to use the domain name listed in the Certificate Application, if a domain name is listed in such Certificate Application. If you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then Thawte will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines. The following applies to Thawte SSL123 Certificates only:\t The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a Medium Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. Medium Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. Furthermore, Medium Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application. Upon Thawte's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Thawte will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Thawte will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Thawte of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Thawte may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate. Further, Thawte recognizes that, from time to time, you may need to re-issue your Certificate. Thawte shall re-issue your Certificate in accordance with its re-issue policy located in the Thawte CPS at https://www.thawte.com/repository/.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate: (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; (iii) on more than one physical server or Device at a time, unless you have purchased additional licenses that permit the use of a Certificate on multiple Devices (\"Licensed Certificate Option\") or; (iv) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you have selected the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Thawte expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. THAWTE CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. If you choose to display the Thawte Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the Conditions of Use of the Thawte Seal published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify Thawte. Thawte retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if: (i) Thawte discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) Thawte determines in its sole discretion, that the continued use of your Certificate may compromise the security or integrity of the Thawte PKI. Thawte may also revoke your Certificate for non-payment.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from all devices on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter. If you have installed a Thawte Seal in conjunction with the revoked Certificate, then you shall remove such seal from your website.\r\n\r\n7. Term of Service. This Agreement shall remain in effect until your Certificate has expired or is earlier revoked.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 Thawte Representations and Warranties. Thawte represents and warrants that: (i) there are no errors introduced by Thawte in the Certificate information as a result of Thawte's failure to use reasonable care in creating the Certificate; (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material respects with its CPS; and (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to its CPS in all material aspects.\r\n\r\n8.2 Your Representations and Warranties.

Description of the Certificate. The following applies to the Thawte SSL Web Server, SSL Web Server With Extended Validation, SSL Web Server Wildcard and SGC SuperCert Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a High Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. High Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. High Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the identity of the Subscriber based on a confirmation that the Subscriber organization does in fact exist, that the organization has authorized the Certificate Application, and that the person submitting the Certificate Application on behalf of the Subscriber was authorized to do so. The Certificate also provides assurances that the Subscriber is entitled to use the domain name listed in the Certificate Application, if a domain name is listed in such Certificate Application. If you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then Thawte will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines. The following applies to Thawte SSL123 Certificates only:\t The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a Medium Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. Medium Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. Furthermore, Medium Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application. Upon Thawte's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Thawte will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Thawte will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Thawte of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Thawte may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate. Further, Thawte recognizes that, from time to time, you may need to re-issue your Certificate. Thawte shall re-issue your Certificate in accordance with its re-issue policy located in the Thawte CPS at https://www.thawte.com/repository/.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions.

If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify Thawte. Thawte retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if: (i) Thawte discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) Thawte determines in its sole discretion, that the continued use of your Certificate may compromise the security or integrity of the Thawte PKI. Thawte may also revoke your Certificate for non-payment.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from all devices on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter. If you have installed a Thawte Seal in conjunction with the revoked Certificate, then you shall remove such seal from your website.\r\n\r\n7. Term of Service.

You further represent and warrant that you have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the extent to which you choose to rely on a digital certificate issued within the Thawte PKI, that you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to rely on such information, and that you shall bear the legal consequences of your failure to perform any obligation you might have as a Relying Party under the applicable Relying Party Agreement.\r\n\r\n8.3 Reseller Representations and Warranties.

This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy.

Description of the Certificate. The following applies to the Thawte SSL Web Server, SSL Web Server With Extended Validation, SSL Web Server Wildcard and SGC SuperCert Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a High Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. High Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. High Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the identity of the Subscriber based on a confirmation that the Subscriber organization does in fact exist, that the organization has authorized the Certificate Application, and that the person submitting the Certificate Application on behalf of the Subscriber was authorized to do so. The Certificate also provides assurances that the Subscriber is entitled to use the domain name listed in the Certificate Application, if a domain name is listed in such Certificate Application. If you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then Thawte will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines. The following applies to Thawte SSL123 Certificates only:\t The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a Medium Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. Medium Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. Furthermore, Medium Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application. Upon Thawte's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Thawte will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Thawte will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Thawte of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Thawte may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate. Further, Thawte recognizes that, from time to time, you may need to re-issue your Certificate. Thawte shall re-issue your Certificate in accordance with its re-issue policy located in the Thawte CPS at https://www.thawte.com/repository/.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate: (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; (iii) on more than one physical server or Device at a time, unless you have purchased additional licenses that permit the use of a Certificate on multiple Devices (\"Licensed Certificate Option\") or; (iv) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you have selected the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Thawte expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. THAWTE CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. If you choose to display the Thawte Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the Conditions of Use of the Thawte Seal published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify Thawte. Thawte retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if: (i) Thawte discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) Thawte determines in its sole discretion, that the continued use of your Certificate may compromise the security or integrity of the Thawte PKI. Thawte may also revoke your Certificate for non-payment.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from all devices on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter. If you have installed a Thawte Seal in conjunction with the revoked Certificate, then you shall remove such seal from your website.\r\n\r\n7. Term of Service. This Agreement shall remain in effect until your Certificate has expired or is earlier revoked.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 Thawte Representations and Warranties. Thawte represents and warrants that: (i) there are no errors introduced by Thawte in the Certificate information as a result of Thawte's failure to use reasonable care in creating the Certificate; (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material respects with its CPS; and (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to its CPS in all material aspects.\r\n\r\n8.2 Your Representations and Warranties.

You further represent and warrant that you have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the extent to which you choose to rely on a digital certificate issued within the Thawte PKI, that you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to rely on such information, and that you shall bear the legal consequences of your failure to perform any obligation you might have as a Relying Party under the applicable Relying Party Agreement.\r\n\r\n8.3 Reseller Representations and Warranties.

This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. If you are not completely satisfied with the Certificate issued to you for any reason, you must request, within thirty (30) days of Certificate issuance, that Thawte revoke the Certificate and provide you with a refund. Following the initial 30-day period, you are entitled to a refund only if Thawte has breached a warranty or other material obligation under this Agreement.

Description of the Certificate. The following applies to the Thawte SSL Web Server, SSL Web Server With Extended Validation, SSL Web Server Wildcard and SGC SuperCert Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a High Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. High Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. High Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the identity of the Subscriber based on a confirmation that the Subscriber organization does in fact exist, that the organization has authorized the Certificate Application, and that the person submitting the Certificate Application on behalf of the Subscriber was authorized to do so. The Certificate also provides assurances that the Subscriber is entitled to use the domain name listed in the Certificate Application, if a domain name is listed in such Certificate Application. If you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then Thawte will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines. The following applies to Thawte SSL123 Certificates only:\t The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a Medium Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. Medium Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. Furthermore, Medium Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application. Upon Thawte's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Thawte will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Thawte will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Thawte of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Thawte may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate. Further, Thawte recognizes that, from time to time, you may need to re-issue your Certificate. Thawte shall re-issue your Certificate in accordance with its re-issue policy located in the Thawte CPS at https://www.thawte.com/repository/.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate: (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; (iii) on more than one physical server or Device at a time, unless you have purchased additional licenses that permit the use of a Certificate on multiple Devices (\"Licensed Certificate Option\") or; (iv) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you have selected the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Thawte expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. THAWTE CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. If you choose to display the Thawte Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the Conditions of Use of the Thawte Seal published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify Thawte. Thawte retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if: (i) Thawte discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) Thawte determines in its sole discretion, that the continued use of your Certificate may compromise the security or integrity of the Thawte PKI. Thawte may also revoke your Certificate for non-payment.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from all devices on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter. If you have installed a Thawte Seal in conjunction with the revoked Certificate, then you shall remove such seal from your website.\r\n\r\n7. Term of Service. This Agreement shall remain in effect until your Certificate has expired or is earlier revoked.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 Thawte Representations and Warranties. Thawte represents and warrants that: (i) there are no errors introduced by Thawte in the Certificate information as a result of Thawte's failure to use reasonable care in creating the Certificate; (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material respects with its CPS; and (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to its CPS in all material aspects.\r\n\r\n8.2 Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant to Thawte and Relying Parties that: (i) all information material to the issuance of a Certificate you provide to Thawte in your Certificate Application is accurate; (ii) you will inform Thawte if the representations you made to Thawte in your Certificate Application changed or are no longer valid; (iii) the Certificate information you provided (including your e-mail address) does not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (iv) the Certificate information you provided (including your email address) has not been and will not be used for any unlawful purpose; (v) you have been (since the time of its creation) and will remain the only person possessing your private key, or any challenge phrase, PIN, software, or hardware mechanism protecting the private key, and no unauthorized person has had or will have access to such materials or information; (vi) you will use your Certificate exclusively for authorized and legal purposes consistent with this Agreement; (vii) you will use your Certificate as an end user and not as a Certification Authority to issue Certificates, certification revocation lists, or otherwise; (viii) each digital signature created using your private key is the Subscriber's digital signature, and the Certificate has been accepted and is operational (not expired or revoked) at the time the digital signature is created; (ix) you manifest assent to this Agreement as a condition of obtaining a Certificate; and (x) you will not monitor, interfere with, or reverse engineer (save to the extent that you can not be prohibited from so doing under applicable law) the technical implementation of the Thawte PKI, except with the prior written approval from Thawte, and shall not otherwise intentionally compromise the security of the Thawte PKI. You further represent and warrant that you have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the extent to which you choose to rely on a digital certificate issued within the Thawte PKI, that you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to rely on such information, and that you shall bear the legal consequences of your failure to perform any obligation you might have as a Relying Party under the applicable Relying Party Agreement.\r\n\r\n8.3 Reseller Representations and Warranties.

All payments due to Thawte shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, Thawte receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. If you are not completely satisfied with the Certificate issued to you for any reason, you must request, within thirty (30) days of Certificate issuance, that Thawte revoke the Certificate and provide you with a refund. Following the initial 30-day period, you are entitled to a refund only if Thawte has breached a warranty or other material obligation under this Agreement.

You acknowledge that Thawte and its licensors retain all Intellectual Property Rights and title in and to all of their confidential information or other proprietary information, products, services, and the ideas, concepts, techniques, inventions, processes, software or works of authorship developed, embodied in, or practiced in connection with the services provided by Thawte hereunder, including without limitation all modifications, enhancements, derivative works, configurations, translations, upgrades, and interfaces thereto (all of the foregoing, \"Thawte Works\").

Description of the Certificate. The following applies to the Thawte SSL Web Server, SSL Web Server With Extended Validation, SSL Web Server Wildcard and SGC SuperCert Certificates only: The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a High Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. High Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. High Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the identity of the Subscriber based on a confirmation that the Subscriber organization does in fact exist, that the organization has authorized the Certificate Application, and that the person submitting the Certificate Application on behalf of the Subscriber was authorized to do so. The Certificate also provides assurances that the Subscriber is entitled to use the domain name listed in the Certificate Application, if a domain name is listed in such Certificate Application. If you have applied for an Extended Validation Certificate, then Thawte will authenticate your Certificate according to the Extended Validation Certificate guidelines. The following applies to Thawte SSL123 Certificates only:\t The Certificate for which you have applied on behalf of your organization is a Medium Assurance Certificate within the Thawte PKI. Medium Assurance Certificates are issued to Devices to provide validation of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server); message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. Furthermore, Medium Assurance Certificates provide assurances of the validity of the domain (unless issued to an intranet server) and that the domain administrator has authorized the Certificate Application. No organization authentication is performed on the owner of the domain.\r\n\r\n3. Processing the Certificate Application. Upon Thawte's receipt of the necessary payment and upon completion of authentication procedures required for the Certificate you have selected, Thawte will process your Certificate Application. If your Certificate Application is approved, Thawte will issue you a Certificate for your use in accordance with this Agreement. After you pick up or otherwise install your Certificate, you must review the information in it and promptly notify Thawte of any errors. Upon receipt of such notice, Thawte may revoke your Certificate and issue you a corrected Certificate. Further, Thawte recognizes that, from time to time, you may need to re-issue your Certificate. Thawte shall re-issue your Certificate in accordance with its re-issue policy located in the Thawte CPS at https://www.thawte.com/repository/.\r\n\r\n4. Use Restrictions. You are prohibited from using your Certificate: (i) for or on behalf of any other organization; (ii) to perform private or public key operations in connection with any domain and/or organization name other than the one you submitted on your Certificate Application; (iii) on more than one physical server or Device at a time, unless you have purchased additional licenses that permit the use of a Certificate on multiple Devices (\"Licensed Certificate Option\") or; (iv) for use as control equipment in hazardous circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance such as the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control systems, or weapons control systems, where failure could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe environmental damage. If you have selected the Licensed Certificate Option, you acknowledge and agree that this option can result in increased security risks to your network and that Thawte expressly disclaims any liability for breaches of security that result from the distribution of a single key across multiple devices. THAWTE CONSIDERS THE UNLICENSED USE OF A CERTIFICATE ON A DEVICE THAT RESIDES ABOVE A SERVER OR SERVER FARM PIRACY AND WILL PURSUE VIOLATORS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. If you choose to display the Thawte Seal, you must install and display such seal only in accordance with the Conditions of Use of the Thawte Seal published in the Repository.\r\n\r\n5. Revocation. If you discover or have reason to believe there has been a compromise of your private key, or the information within your Certificate is incorrect or has changed, or if your organization name and/or domain name registration has changed, you must immediately notify Thawte. Thawte retains the right to revoke your Certificate at any time without notice if: (i) Thawte discovers that the information within your Certificate is no longer valid; (ii) you fail to perform your obligations under the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) Thawte determines in its sole discretion, that the continued use of your Certificate may compromise the security or integrity of the Thawte PKI. Thawte may also revoke your Certificate for non-payment.\r\n\r\n6. Obligations Upon Revocation or Expiration. Upon expiration or notice of revocation of your Certificate, you shall permanently remove your Certificate from all devices on which it is installed and shall not use it for any purpose thereafter. If you have installed a Thawte Seal in conjunction with the revoked Certificate, then you shall remove such seal from your website.\r\n\r\n7. Term of Service. This Agreement shall remain in effect until your Certificate has expired or is earlier revoked.\r\n\r\n8. Representations and Warranties.\r\n\r\n8.1 Thawte Representations and Warranties. Thawte represents and warrants that: (i) there are no errors introduced by Thawte in the Certificate information as a result of Thawte's failure to use reasonable care in creating the Certificate; (ii) its issuance of Certificates shall comply in all material respects with its CPS; and (iii) its revocation services and use of a Repository conform to its CPS in all material aspects.\r\n\r\n8.2 Your Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant to Thawte and Relying Parties that: (i) all information material to the issuance of a Certificate you provide to Thawte in your Certificate Application is accurate; (ii) you will inform Thawte if the representations you made to Thawte in your Certificate Application changed or are no longer valid; (iii) the Certificate information you provided (including your e-mail address) does not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (iv) the Certificate information you provided (including your email address) has not been and will not be used for any unlawful purpose; (v) you have been (since the time of its creation) and will remain the only person possessing your private key, or any challenge phrase, PIN, software, or hardware mechanism protecting the private key, and no unauthorized person has had or will have access to such materials or information; (vi) you will use your Certificate exclusively for authorized and legal purposes consistent with this Agreement; (vii) you will use your Certificate as an end user and not as a Certification Authority to issue Certificates, certification revocation lists, or otherwise; (viii) each digital signature created using your private key is the Subscriber's digital signature, and the Certificate has been accepted and is operational (not expired or revoked) at the time the digital signature is created; (ix) you manifest assent to this Agreement as a condition of obtaining a Certificate; and (x) you will not monitor, interfere with, or reverse engineer (save to the extent that you can not be prohibited from so doing under applicable law) the technical implementation of the Thawte PKI, except with the prior written approval from Thawte, and shall not otherwise intentionally compromise the security of the Thawte PKI. You further represent and warrant that you have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to the extent to which you choose to rely on a digital certificate issued within the Thawte PKI, that you are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to rely on such information, and that you shall bear the legal consequences of your failure to perform any obligation you might have as a Relying Party under the applicable Relying Party Agreement.\r\n\r\n8.3 Reseller Representations and Warranties. Further to section 8.2, Reseller represents and warrants to Thawte and Relying Parties that: (i) it has obtained the authority of its customer to enter into this Agreement on behalf of its customer and/or to bind its customer to this Agreement; and (ii) it shall comply with and procure its customer's compliance with this Agreement.\r\n\r\n9.

All payments due to Thawte shall be made without any deduction or withholding on account of any tax, duty, charge, penalty, or otherwise except as required by law in which case the sum payable by you in respect of which such deduction or withholding is to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after making such deduction or withholding, Thawte receives and retains (free from any liability in respect thereof) a net sum equal to the sum it would have received but for such deduction or withholding being required. This section does not apply to you if you purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n10. Refund Policy. If you are not completely satisfied with the Certificate issued to you for any reason, you must request, within thirty (30) days of Certificate issuance, that Thawte revoke the Certificate and provide you with a refund. Following the initial 30-day period, you are entitled to a refund only if Thawte has breached a warranty or other material obligation under this Agreement. This Section does not apply to you if you have purchased your Certificate from a Reseller.\r\n\r\n11. Proprietary Rights. You acknowledge that Thawte and its licensors retain all Intellectual Property Rights and title in and to all of their confidential information or other proprietary information, products, services, and the ideas, concepts, techniques, inventions, processes, software or works of authorship developed, embodied in, or practiced in connection with the services provided by Thawte hereunder, including without limitation all modifications, enhancements, derivative works, configurations, translations, upgrades, and interfaces thereto (all of the foregoing, \"Thawte Works\").
